Experimental scala / akka project

## Version

0.0.1

## Getting Started

The current, development version of this experiment can most easily be run under sbt. Once you have the pre-requisites installed, you can compile and run the experiment under sbt, in the customary manner. Subsequently a webserver attempts to run at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) under port 44444. Assuming this works, you can now read more elaborate documentation by opening [this link](http://localhost:44444).

### Prerequisites
scala 1.12, java 8, sbt 0.13

### Installing

sbt compile
sbt run

## Running the tests
